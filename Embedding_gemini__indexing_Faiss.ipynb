All\\nnext-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,\\ngluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as\\nall-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at\\nnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is\\nspecified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is\\ndemonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for\\nmore detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for\\ndistributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron\\nCollider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs\\nboson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing\\nthat enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious\\nselection of events.\\n'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}],"source":["df_data['prepared_text'][0]"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MHKWRq2--m3i"},"source":["# Embed data"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["GOOGLE_API_KEY='AIzaSyBN6_iW25NEfLLxScsDThFDJm6F3evMPb0'\n","genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"pmaphzzcWflL"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"uo6YfJFgu67C"},"outputs":[],"source":["import time\n","start = time.time()\n","\n","result = genai.embed_content(\n","    model=\"models/embedding-001\",\n","    content=list(df_data['prepared_text'][:100000]),\n","    task_type=\"retrieval_document\",\n","    title=\"Embedding of list of paper abstracts\")\n","\n","embeds = np.array(result['embedding']).astype('float32')\n","\n","end = time.time()\n","print(end-start) #40mins"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":3,"status":"ok","timestamp":1713051786995,"user":{"displayName":"Aadyant Khatri","userId":"04658209455805406207"},"user_tz":240},"id":"9JFDl4ctMJGh","outputId":"480d512a-f82e-4a85-a42a-60d00c818b9f"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(100000, 768)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":11}],"source":["embeds_annoy.shape"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FpzOJKir-sIp"},"source":["# Use Faiss to store the embeddings"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"-1UKrRJl1Hm6"},"outputs":[],"source":["start = time.time()\n","\n","index = faiss.IndexIDMap(faiss.IndexFlatIP(768))\n","index.add_with_ids(embeds, np.arange(len(df_data['prepared_text'][:100000])))\n","\n","path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/VT/Information Storage Project Files/indices/gemini_faiss_100000.index'\n","\n","end = time.time()\n","print(end-start)\n","# Save index\n","faiss.write_index(index, path)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8UyZ42Q7-01z"},"source":["# Load Faiss indices"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ls0Bhmqa3qQp"},"outputs":[],"source":["path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/VT/Information Storage Project Files/indices/gemini_faiss_100000.index'\n","index = faiss.read_index(path)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"W774w-hr_SNw"},"source":["# Get top k results"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"62L7P8mc3qOR"},"outputs":[],"source":["def get_top_results(query, k):\n","  input_type_query = \"search_query\"\n","\n","  query_embed = genai.embed_content(\n","      model=\"models/embedding-001\",\n","      content=query,\n","      task_type=\"retrieval_query\",)\n","\n","  top_k = index.search(np.array([query_embed['embedding']]).astype('float32'), k)\n","\n","  query_results = pd.DataFrame(data={'id': df_data.iloc[top_k[1][0]]['id'],\n","                                     'texts': df_data.iloc[top_k[1][0]]['prepared_text'],\n","                                     'authors': df_data.iloc[top_k[1][0]]['authors'],\n","                                     'doi': df_data.iloc[top_k[1][0]]['doi'],\n","                                     'distance': top_k[0][0]})\n","\n","  return query_results"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":658},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":765,"status":"ok","timestamp":1712607350596,"user":{"displayName":"Aadyant Khatri","userId":"04658209455805406207"},"user_tz":240},"id":"4bjjw7Sx3qLg","outputId":"f29544a8-d7f0-46fe-85cd-9dbf92dc9aa7"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["            id                                              texts  \\\n","201  0704.0202  {title}: Towards Minimal Resources of Measurem...   \n","322  0704.0323  {title}: General sequential quantum cloning {a...   \n","41   0704.0042  {title}: General System theory, Like-Quantum S...   \n","481  0704.0482  {title}: Implementation of holonomic quantum c...   \n","33   0704.0034  {title}: Origin of adaptive mutants: a quantum...   \n","267  0704.0268  {title}: Automated Generation of Layout and Co...   \n","408  0704.0409  {title}: On the over-barrier reflection in qua...   \n","277  0704.0278  {title}: q-Deformed spin foam models of quantu...   \n","419  0704.0420  {title}: The Hourglass -

The emission was predicted to contribute to the diffuse\\nextragalactic background even at large angular distances from the Sun. While\\nthis emission is expected to be readily detectable in future by GLAST, the\\nsituation for available EGRET data is more challenging. We present a detailed\\nstudy of the EGRET database, using a time dependent analysis, accounting for\\nthe effect of the emission from 3C 279, the moon, and other sources, which\\ninterfere with the solar signal. The technique has been tested on the moon\\nsignal, with results consistent with previous work. We find clear evidence for\\nemission from the Sun and its vicinity. The observations are compared with our\\nmodel for the extended emission.\\n\",\n          \"  This paper is an exposition of the so-called injective Morita contexts (in\\nwhich the connecting bimodule morphisms are injective) and Morita\\n$\\\\alpha$contexts (in which the connecting bimodules enjoy some local\\nprojectivity in the sense of Zimmermann-Huisgen). Motivated by situations in\\nwhich only one trace ideal is in action, or the compatibility between the\\nbimodule morphisms is not needed, we introduce the notions of Morita\\nsemi-contexts and Morita data, and investigate them. Injective Morita data will\\nbe used (with the help of static and adstatic modules) to establish\\nequivalences between some intersecting subcategories related to subcategories\\nof modules that are localized or colocalized by trace ideals of a Morita datum.\\nWe end up with applications of Morita $\\\\alpha$-contexts to $\\\\ast$-modules and\\ninjective right wide Morita contexts.\\n\",\n          \"  A perturbative model is studied for the tunneling of many-particle states\\nfrom the ground band to the first excited energy band, mimicking Landau-Zener\\ndecay for ultracold, spinless atoms in quasi-one dimensional optical lattices\\nsubjected to a tunable tilting force.

We estimate the\\nimpact of this flux on the formation of molecular hydrogen and cooling in the\\nfirst galaxies, assuming different types of radiation sources (e.g. Pop II and\\nPop III stars, miniquasars). We find that H- photodissociation reduces the\\nformation of H2 molecules by a factor of ~1+1000k_s*x/(f_esc*delta), where x is\\nthe mean ionized fraction in the IGM, f_esc is the fraction of ionizing photons\\nthat escape from their progenitor halos, delta is the local gas overdensity and\\nk_s is an order unity constant which depends on the type of radiation source.\\nBy the time a significant fraction of the universe becomes ionized, H-\\nphotodissociation may significantly reduce the H2 abundance and, with it, the\\nprimordial star formation rate, delaying the progress of reionization.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Zihua Weng\",\n          \"B.F.L.
