All\\nnext-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,\\ngluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as\\nall-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at\\nnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is\\nspecified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is\\ndemonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for\\nmore detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for\\ndistributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron\\nCollider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs\\nboson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing\\nthat enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious\\nselection of

To motivate automated layout for\\nquantum circuits, we investigate grid-based layouts and show a performance\\nvariance of four times as we vary grid structure and initial qubit placement.\\nWe then propose two polynomial-time design heuristics: a greedy algorithm\\nsuitable for small, congestion-free quantum circuits and a dataflow-based\\nanalysis approach to placement and routing with implicit initial placement of\\nqubits. Finally, we show that our dataflow-based heuristic generates better\\nlayouts than the state-of-the-art automated grid-based layout and scheduling\\nmechanism in terms of latency and potential pipelinability, but at the cost of\\nsome area.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Donald McCartor\",\n          \"Gui-Fang Dang, and Heng Fan\",\n          \"Mark Whitney, Nemanja Isailovic, Yatish Patel, John Kubiatowicz\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"doi\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"10.1088/1367-2630/9/6/206\",\n          \"10.1088/1751-8113/41/15/155303\",\n          \"10.1063/1.2779138\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"distance\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.02428802576601264,\n        \"min\": 0.8005602955818176,\n        \"max\": 0.8804957270622253,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8730124235153198,\n          0.8253064155578613,\n          0.8455531597137451\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}","type":"dataframe"},"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-e58796b1-76ad-4689-b79b-b03843a67592\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>id</th>\n","      <th>texts</th>\n","      <th>authors</th>\n","      <th>doi</th>\n","      <th>distance</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>201</th>\n","      <td>0704.0202</td>\n","      <td>{title}: Towards Minimal Resources of Measurem...</td>\n","      <td>Simon Perdrix</td>\n","      <td>10.1088/1367-2630/9/6/206</td>\n","      <td>0.800560</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>322</th>\n","      <td>0704.0323</td>\n","      <td>{title}: General sequential quantum cloning {a...</td>\n","      <td>Gui-Fang Dang, and Heng Fan</td>\n","      <td>10.1088/1751-8113/41/15/155303</td>\n","      <td>0.825306</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>41</th>\n","      <td>0704.0042</td>\n","      <td>{title}: General System theory, Like-Quantum S...</td>\n","      <td>Ignazio Licata</td>\n","      <td>None</td>\n","      <td>0.842215</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>481</th>\n","      <td>0704.0482</td>\n","      <td>{title}: Implementation of holonomic quantum c...</td>\n","      <td>Zhang-qi Yin, Fu-li Li, Peng Peng</td>\n","      <td>10.1103/PhysRevA.76.062311</td>\n","      <td>0.843863</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>33</th>\n","      <td>0704.0034</td>\n","      <td>{title}: Origin of adaptive mutants: a quantum...</td>\n","      <td>Vasily Ogryzko</td>\n","      <td>None</td>\n","      <td>0.844965</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>267</th>\n","      <td>0704.0268</td>\n","      <td>{title}: Automated Generation of Layout and Co...</td>\n","      <td>Mark Whitney, Nemanja Isailovic, Yatish Patel,...</td>\n","      <td>None</td>\n","      <td>0.845553</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>408</th>\n","      <td>0704.0409</td>\n","      <td>{title}: On the over-barrier reflection in qua...</td>\n","      <td>D.G.

The emission was predicted to contribute to the diffuse\\nextragalactic background even at large angular distances from the Sun. While\\nthis emission is expected to be readily detectable in future by GLAST, the\\nsituation for available EGRET data is more challenging. We present a detailed\\nstudy of the EGRET database, using a time dependent analysis, accounting for\\nthe effect of the emission from 3C 279, the moon, and other sources, which\\ninterfere with the solar signal. The technique has been tested on the moon\\nsignal, with results consistent with previous work. We find clear evidence for\\nemission from the Sun and its vicinity. The observations are compared with our\\nmodel for the extended emission.\\n\",\n          \"  This paper is an exposition of the so-called injective Morita contexts (in\\nwhich the connecting bimodule morphisms are injective) and Morita\\n$\\\\alpha$contexts (in which the connecting bimodules enjoy some local\\nprojectivity in the sense of Zimmermann-Huisgen). Motivated by situations in\\nwhich only one trace ideal is in action, or the compatibility between the\\nbimodule morphisms is not needed, we introduce the notions of Morita\\nsemi-contexts and Morita data, and investigate them. Injective Morita data will\\nbe used (with the help of static and adstatic modules) to establish\\nequivalences between some intersecting subcategories related to subcategories\\nof modules that are localized or colocalized by trace ideals of a Morita datum.\\nWe end up with applications of Morita $\\\\alpha$-contexts to $\\\\ast$-modules and\\ninjective right wide Morita contexts.\\n\",\n          \"  A perturbative model is studied for the tunneling of many-particle states\\nfrom the ground band to the first excited energy band, mimicking Landau-Zener\\ndecay for ultracold, spinless atoms in quasi-one dimensional optical lattices\\nsubjected to a tunable tilting force.
